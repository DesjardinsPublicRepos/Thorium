The program itself is working properly, but there will be some UI improvements in the future. Also the program has a few little issues that i will resolve later.

Installer in "\MP4toMP3Converter\publish". It will aditionally install dependencies for the .net 4.7.2 Framework if not present.
The used font "Century Gothic" is due to licensing issues not included. If you want to use it anyways, drag the tff into the properties and recompile.

You can ignore the "\.vs" folder. It also may be hidden.
